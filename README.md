C program for generating Pascal's Triangle to 23 lines. It is colour coded to make up for the loss in formatting the larger numbers cause.

I have variations on this where symbols are printed instead.

There is another version included here that shows the relationship between Pascal's Triangle and the Fibonacci sequence.
